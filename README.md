# LifeOfTheMind

## Welcome

Welcome to UChicago, home of "Life of the Mind" aka "Where Fun Goes to Die."  
Here's a game that reflects what's going on on the inside of your mind. Think *Inside Out* (the movie) meets Pocket God. 

## Live Demo

(Eventually we'll have a link here)

## Setup


1. Clone this repo
2. Install Muse dependencies

## Run

1. Turn on muse
2. Run this command: `muse-io --device $MUSENAME --osc osc.udp://localhost:5000`  
   Where the $MUSENAME is what shows up in your Bluetooth menu.
3. Run the game
